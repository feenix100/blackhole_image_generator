Ever wondered what happens when code meets the cosmos? 🚀 In this video, we dive deep into the math, physics, and creative coding behind simulating a black hole with Rust. Using gravitational lensing approximations, chromatic bending, and procedural noise, we generate a visually stunning black hole surrounded by a swirling rainbow photon ring and glowing nebula backdrop.

I encourage you to modify this program using real data. I used chat gpt 5.

✨ What you’ll see in this video:

🌈 A randomly generated rainbow ring swirling around the black hole’s photon sphere.

🔥 A dynamic accretion disk with Doppler boosting and gravitational redshift.

🌌 A procedural nebula background for cinematic depth.

💻 The Rust code powering the entire simulation.

Whether you’re into astrophysics, creative coding, or Rust programming, this project shows how math and code can create jaw-dropping visuals inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity.
